# codingTasks

This will be the place where I put all the tasks, projects and other small parts of code. 
Will be adding to this as my journey with programming develops and hopefully that shows in the quality of my work.
My first Django project is making a sticky notes application that allows the the user to create an account and use that to store the
detailed sticky notes within that user. Have also added admin functionality with urls on each page within the URLs.py file.
